# odin-landing-page

TOP Landing Page Project

This is a project related to completing The Odin Project.

It will utilize HTML and CSS to create a simple Landing Page.

I'll be demonstrating an understanding of:

-HTML Syntax

-CSS Styling

-Basic HTML Tags

-Basic CSS implementation

-Git

This is my first project being completed on MacOS without the ideal Odin Project development environment, with work taking place on both a Workplace provided computer without Administrator Access or the capability for a stable Virtual Machine (M1 Chipset is not officially supported by Oracle at the time of this project) and on my personal laptop in tandem.

It'll be my first opportunity to edit a project across multiple machines, and it'll be my first opportunity to troubleshoot the web development workflow without The Odin Projects suggested development environment.
